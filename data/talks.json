    "text": "The presentation of art works requires a very versatile and flexible web application. Artists use different media and presentation formats (exhibition, installation, performance, dance, music, etc.). Portfolio is a state-of-the-art research information system designed specifically for the needs of artists. Portfolio’s requirements included creating different and flexible object types which can be defined through a controlled vocabulary maintained by a special non-technical user group.\nPortfolio is built with Django. To fulfill the requirement of flexible and expandable object types a single PostgreSQL JSON database field is used to save object specific data. Data schemes for JSON serialized data are built with marshmallow, a library for simplified object serialization. Skosmos is used to publish, and provide a REST API for the controlled vocabulary which is maintained by non-technical users through VocBench, a web-based, collaborative development platform for managing SKOS thesauri. Portfolio provides a REST API for its Vue.js powered frontend and communication to other applications."

Many software projects, including Python projects, are being migrated to Kubernetes nowadays. The vision of a beautiful Cloud-native ecosystem powered by Kubernetes, where the smallest misbehavior of services is detected and everything scales automatically is very nice. However, the way to such an ecosystem can be longer and harder than it seems to be. What are the real challenges of migrating complex Python system to Kubernetes? What are the threats you should be aware of?\n\nThis talk summarizes the experience gained during the migration of booking, one of the most critical Python services at Kiwi.com, to Google Kubernetes Engine. Booking is a mixture of legacy services, new services based on Flask and asynchronous Celery tasks.

    "text": "Python is a very readable, dynamically typed, interpreted, object oriented general purpose programming language that’s easy to learn, but offers almost unlimited power and flexibility to build almost whatever you want. However, as you go deeper into Python, some of the very features that made you fall in love with the language may start to limit what you can do: dynamic typing can make bugs hard to spot, large codebases can create a sea of objects, and the global interpreter lock (GIL) starts to impose a hard limit on performance. \n\nMeanwhile, Rust - a relatively new compiled systems programming language - is statically (and safely) typed, and offers and \"\"fearless\"\" concurrency without the limitations of the GIL; indeed, idiomatic Rust code runs at comparable speeds to C/C++. However, despite having a brilliant community, Rust is acknowledged as presenting a steep learning curve, and with so much Python being used in data science, academia, industry and beyond, switching entirely to Rust simply isn’t a sensible option for most teams. \n\nAt decisionLab, a mathematical modelling and data science consultancy based in central London, we wanted to improve our Python code quality and maintainability as much as possible, whilst also making use of the speed improvements that Rust could offer for some of our most performance critical algorithms.\n\nSo, we embraced typed Python, whilst also exploring Rust. So far, the effects on our code have been excellent. Not only did we spot bugs and improve our documentation using typed Python, but we were also able to use high level tools which leverage typed Python to build APIs and interfaces to our code and accelerate development. Best of all, using Rust from within our Python code was much easier than expected.\n\nThis talk will give a brief overview of typed Python, and how and why you would want to use it, alongside an overview of some excellent high-level tools that let your typed code fly. I'll also give an introduction to Rust the language, and the two major Rust-Python bindings: PyO3 and Rust-Python. We’ll then explore an example of how to write a Rust module and use it in Python.\n\nHopefully, I'll convince you that you don't need to be a computer science genius to work with a systems programming language, and that using Rust in your code doesn't require a complete re-write, but that you can actually start to swap-and-switch your code into Rust class by class, function by function.\n\nAt the same time, I'll reflect on the roles of Rust, Python and code generally in solving business problems. My aim in this talk is to show that Rust and Python are not enemies or competitors, but rather that they are different tools with different uses, and that when they are used in combination, great things can happen! In doing so, I'll offer my take on what I think the future of Rust is in Python."

We describe a successful working model for the teaching of Computer pRogamming.\n\nComputer Science is now regarded as one of the leading disciplines in the 21st century. Computers are ubiquitous and prevalent in most, if not all, sectors of our modern society – applications include using them in weather forecasting, robotic surgery, space exploration, e-commerce, smart cities, driverless cars, etc.\n\nTherefore, coding or computer programming is now regarded by many as an essential skill for the young person, and it has been dubbed the ‘4th’ R’ (computer pRogramming) along with Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic.\n\nIn recognition of the new status of computer programming, governments worldwide have launched initiatives to have it taught in schools from Kindergarten through to junior school and all the way through secondary school.\n\nSo, the question emerges is how do we best teach and motivate the next generation in acquiring this skill? Given the fact that this field is very much in its infancy, there are insufficient number of skilled Computer Science teachers and very little pedagogy to guide the educator. Therefore, the whole world is learning how best to teach this subject by trial and error.\n\nThe talk will describe a case study whereby coding/computer programming, in the form of Python programming, was introduced to a group of 110 young people from the ages of 11 to 18 (Years 7-13 in a U.K secondary school). The talk will include descriptions of the various teaching methodologies introduced to the young people for this purpose and the outcomes; the talk will also address various challenges and questions about how to teach coding to young people. The talk will conclude with helpful suggestions, based on the findings of the case study, on how to proceed with the teaching of computer programming to these people."

Data from these stations are examined by quality control during which the erroneous data are removed from the assessment of the PV potential. The recognition of erroneous data is in many cases non-trivial, especially as the errors are hidden in changing weather conditions. Typical causes of erroneous data are e.g. shading, soiling, snow, dew and frost on the sensor. Nowadays, the quality assessment of the data is mainly performed by visual inspection and therefore must be done by domain-skilled data operator.\n\nThe poster will present to you, how by a combination of domain knowledge, agile process, statistics, machine learning, and Python such quality assessment can be automatized. Specifically, it will be shown, how all these areas are applied to automatically recognize the most usual issue – shading on the sensor by near and far objects. The poster will show you a real-world data example and will walk you through steps of algorithm which has a recall of 81.2% and a false-positive rate of 2.5%. Finally, the possibilities of improvements as well as the challenges and lessons learned will be also discussed.\n\nThe developed shading recognition algorithm described in the poster reduces the work of the domain data operator from hours to minutes. Moreover, it opens a possibility for customers to assess the data quality on their own without a need for a domain data operator. The combination of this automatic data quality control with existing vitalization and data-handling tools (all coded in Python) make this product unique on the market."

    "text": "Po mnohé roky vnímame počítače ako stroje, ktoré nám pomáhajú svojimi algoritmami pri riešení najrôznejších problémov. V dobe, keď sú tranzistory malé a Mooreov zákon prestáva byť platný, je len malá nádej na efektívne riešenie tzv. nepolyminálnych problémov pomocou klasických počítačov. Jedno z možných riešení na prehľadávanie priestoru určitých problémov sú kvantové počítače pracujúce na báze qubitov. Ich efektivita oproti počítačom s klasickými bitmi je neporovnateľná. Napriek tomu sú kvantové počítače stále vo svojich začiatkoch a len málokto má tú možnosť fyzicky s nimi pracovať. Dnes však môžeme pracovať s kvantovými počítačmi z pohodlia nášho domova - pomocou python knižnice Qiskit vytvoriť kvantové obvody a poslať ich do jedného z niekoľkých reálnych kvantových počítačov. Výsledky z kvantového počítača pracujúceho až s 15 qubitmi tak môže získať ktokoľvek. A to je len začiatok novej, stále neprebádanej éry."

    "text": "When I first heard about Celery three years ago, my first idea was \"Why would anyone call a tool for managing async tasks 'Salary'?\" Nowadays I am realizing that similar misunderstandings were actually quite often during my work with this tool.\n\nI want to talk about my experiences with Celery, from total beginner to a-few-times-trapped user. Together with my colleagues, we started with simple tasks that were periodically gathering data and computing aggregate values of timeseries within a research project. This was actually copybook example of Celery usage, with little bit of Celery beat and tasks chaining. Saturated with success, I decided to use Celery for Layman, a web service that publishes even large geospatial datasets through REST API. Redis as a broker, Flask as web application framework. There came need to effectively and safely abort running task. Or actually chain of tasks. And sometimes from different process than the one that started the chain. That's where thing got unexpectedly complicated and story of AbortableAsyncResult, persisting results and tracking task states starts."

Najčastejšie aplikácie sú z počítačového videnia, rozpoznávania textu a reči - rôzne úlohy klasifikácie alebo segmentácie.\n\nReinforcement learning (RL, učenie odmenou a trestom) predstavuje menej známi prístup. Bol to práve RL - program AlphaGO, ktorý v roku 2016 porazil svetového majstra v hre GO  a v roku 2019 pro-gamera v hre StarCraft (program AlphaStar).\n\nSpôsob učenia spočíva v hraní tisícok hier, získavania odmien a učenie sa z nich. Takýto agent je schopný hraním hry sám so sebou prekonať ľudských hráčov, aj \"\"hard coded\"\" botov.\n\nV prednáške ukážem základne myšlienky RL, ako vyzerá kód s použitím knižníc pytorch a aigym, ak nezabudnem, aj nejaké typy čo sa nedajú nájsť a čím sa trebalo popasovať - ono je pekné keď veci idú, ale keď nejdú je to ozaj boj ...\n\nPre nedočkavých prikladám video ako to pracuje : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQIShnTz1kU\nA podobne aj kód (pre účely pyconu ale urobím menší repozitár) : https://github.com/michalnand/reinforcement_learning/tree/master/src\nkde budú jednoduhšie príklady a tréning sieti bude trvať len pár minút (namiesto pár dní)"

MQTT is great for IoT because it offers guaranteed message delivery even when a device is asleep or offline. MQTT is great for managing complexity, because it lets you organize communication as a taxonomy of topics.\n\nMQTT is an important technology because there may soon be more devices running MQTT than HTTP! Come to this lecture to learn the basics of MQTT, to find out if it is right for your application, and to get advice on which MQTT libraries and tools Python developers should use.\n\nThe speaker teaches MQTT Classes in Python, Javascript, GoLang and Erlang.\n\n\nHere are the talk slides: https://pythonlinks.info/presentations/MQTTTalk.pdf\n\nHere is a tree of chat rooms, one for every talk at PyCon USA. https://pythonlinks.info/pycon-usa/chat#children\n\nHere is the list of MQTT classes I am giving. https://pythonlinks.info/mqtt-lecture-and-tutorial"

    "text": "Bioinformatics and Computational Biology are in the intersection of Biology, Data Science, Mathematics, and Informatics. The challenges, tasks, and not to mention the data, are as heterogeneous as life itself. One may have to do a de-novo assembly of a new strain of a pathogen, detect rare gene variants, build models for gene regulation, create interaction networks - the list is almost infinite.\n\nPython offers various specialized libraries and collections of tools for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology such as Biopython, Bioconda, PyBio and more. You can use these for example for read alignment, sequence alignment, variant calling, and other domain specific tasks. Often, these collections contain hundreds of tools, and overlaps in function may occur.\n\nFor more general, but typical tasks of these areas of science - eg. data cleaning, statistics, clustering, classification or image analysis -, one would need other packages available in the Python ecosystem. Typical choices are:\n\n    SciPy\n    scikit-learn / scikit-image\n    NumPy\n    Pandas\n    graph-tool\n    matplotlib\n\n.. and many more.\n\nIt's not easy to find what to use for a given problem, especially if you are new to either of the scientific fields, or Python itself. This talk will give short examples of typical bioinformatics ( including some more general) tasks and how to solve them using some of these tools.\nThe presentation is aimed at the novice-to-intermediate level, and no prior knowledge in Biology (and therefore in Bioinformatics and / or Computational Biology) is needed."

When you have a monolithic application it is relatively easy to create one common authorization layer that is used by the entire system and most engineers don’t have to worry about. But what if you are running a lot of different microservices that are written in multiple languages and communicating with different protocols? This was one of my tasks in the past year and I’d like to share with you our processes of thinking that lead us to develop a distributed system written in Golang using various open-source technologies, such as Open Policy Agent, Envoy Proxy or gRCP, while running everything on top of Kubernetes."

You have a cool idea, but how do you turn it into an application that you can show off to your friends, basking in the warmth of their envy? More importantly, what mistakes do you need to avoid in order to keep the hope of such basking alive?\n\nCome along and hear of my missteps, assumptions exposed and exploded, and the unpleasant surprises that come from doing machine learning in the wild. You'll learn about how to deal with haphazard data entry, depending on the kindness of strangers, boxes of different shapes and sizes, and, finally, what to do when all of this changes, because it will.\n\nIf you're interested in machine learning and are familiar with the basic tools and techniques, but are unsure of how to take a project idea to production, this talk will at least show you what not to do and how not to do it."
