To fulfill the requirement of flexible and expandable object types a single PostgreSQL JSON database field is used to save object specific data. Data schemes for JSON serialized data are built with marshmallow, a library for simplified object serialization. Skosmos is used to publish, and provide a REST API for the controlled vocabulary which is maintained by non-technical users through VocBench, a web-based, collaborative development platform for managing SKOS thesauri.

                "text": "Python is a very readable, dynamically typed, interpreted, object oriented general purpose programming language that’s easy to learn, but offers almost unlimited power and flexibility to build almost whatever you want. However, as you go deeper into Python, some of the very features that made you fall in love with the language may start to limit what you can do: dynamic typing can make bugs hard to spot, large codebases can create a sea of objects, and the global interpreter lock (GIL) starts to impose a hard limit on performance. \n\nMeanwhile, Rust - a relatively new compiled systems programming language - is statically (and safely) typed, and offers and \"\"fearless\"\" concurrency without the limitations of the GIL; indeed, idiomatic Rust code runs at comparable speeds to C/C++. However, despite having a brilliant community, Rust is acknowledged as presenting a steep learning curve, and with so much Python being used in data science, academia, industry and beyond, switching entirely to Rust simply isn’t a sensible option for most teams. \n\nAt decisionLab, a mathematical modelling and data science consultancy based in central London, we wanted to improve our Python code quality and maintainability as much as possible, whilst also making use of the speed improvements that Rust could offer for some of our most performance critical algorithms.\n\nSo, we embraced typed Python, whilst also exploring Rust. So far, the effects on our code have been excellent. Not only did we spot bugs and improve our documentation using typed Python, but we were also able to use high level tools which leverage typed Python to build APIs and interfaces to our code and accelerate development. Best of all, using Rust from within our Python code was much easier than expected.\n\nThis talk will give a brief overview of typed Python, and how and why you would want to use it, alongside an overview of some excellent high-level tools that let your typed code fly. I'll also give an introduction to Rust the language, and the two major Rust-Python bindings: PyO3 and Rust-Python. We’ll then explore an example of how to write a Rust module and use it in Python.\n\nHopefully, I'll convince you that you don't need to be a computer science genius to work with a systems programming language, and that using Rust in your code doesn't require a complete re-write, but that you can actually start to swap-and-switch your code into Rust class by class, function by function.\n\nAt the same time, I'll reflect on the roles of Rust, Python and code generally in solving business problems. My aim in this talk is to show that Rust and Python are not enemies or competitors, but rather that they are different tools with different uses, and that when they are used in combination, great things can happen! In doing so, I'll offer my take on what I think the future of Rust is in Python."

We describe a successful working model for the teaching of Computer pRogamming.\n\nComputer Science is now regarded as one of the leading disciplines in the 21st century. Computers are ubiquitous and prevalent in most, if not all, sectors of our modern society – applications include using them in weather forecasting, robotic surgery, space exploration, e-commerce, smart cities, driverless cars, etc.\n\nTherefore, coding or computer programming is now regarded by many as an essential skill for the young person, and it has been dubbed the ‘4th’ R’ (computer pRogramming) along with Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic.\n\nIn recognition of the new status of computer programming, governments worldwide have launched initiatives to have it taught in schools from Kindergarten through to junior school and all the way through secondary school.\n\nSo, the question emerges is how do we best teach and motivate the next generation in acquiring this skill? Given the fact that this field is very much in its infancy, there are insufficient number of skilled Computer Science teachers and very little pedagogy to guide the educator. Therefore, the whole world is learning how best to teach this subject by trial and error.\n\nThe talk will describe a case study whereby coding/computer programming, in the form of Python programming, was introduced to a group of 110 young people from the ages of 11 to 18 (Years 7-13 in a U.K secondary school). The talk will include descriptions of the various teaching methodologies introduced to the young people for this purpose and the outcomes; the talk will also address various challenges and questions about how to teach coding to young people.

This talk explores serverless use-cases for Python developers.\n\nThis is not another pitch of AWS Lambda. While including the lambda, we will rather discuss Python framework options, how to build more sophisticated workflows and integrations, how to deploy our code across different cloud providers, and finally, how to test and debug the apps, all based on the open-source serverless framework."

Whether you are a fresh college graduate, or a Senior Engineer with multiple years of experience under your belt, this talk will take you on the journey of a team that transformed their code review process from being vague and lacking, to being the biggest investment of their resulting, high quality code output. On this short journey we will specifically\nfocus on:\n\n- The importance of the human factor in code reviews.\n- The value of knowing who the review is for (understanding your audience).\n- What code reviews are and how they should be used effectively.\n- Best practices as well as General Do's and Don'ts.\n\n\nBy the end of this talk your perspective on code reviews should change and you will approach code reviews as what they really are - a Software Engineer's Best Friend (woof! woof!)"

(I wish I was making this up.)\n\nHearing about this in abstract terms is useful, of course. Every talk drives a different point home. It only gets you so far, though. That's why I'm going to take another approach here – I want to tell my personal story as someone who grew up around the block, and try to make a post-mortem of several instances of burnout, so that you can avoid making the same mistakes that I did.

Data from these stations are examined by quality control during which the erroneous data are removed from the assessment of the PV potential. The recognition of erroneous data is in many cases non-trivial, especially as the errors are hidden in changing weather conditions. Typical causes of erroneous data are e.g. shading, soiling, snow, dew and frost on the sensor. Nowadays, the quality assessment of the data is mainly performed by visual inspection and therefore must be done by domain-skilled data operator.\n\nThe poster will present to you, how by a combination of domain knowledge, agile process, statistics, machine learning, and Python such quality assessment can be automatized. Specifically, it will be shown, how all these areas are applied to automatically recognize the most usual issue – shading on the sensor by near and far objects. The poster will show you a real-world data example and will walk you through steps of algorithm which has a recall of 81.2% and a false-positive rate of 2.5%. Finally, the possibilities of improvements as well as the challenges and lessons learned will be also discussed.\n\nThe developed shading recognition algorithm described in the poster reduces the work of the domain data operator from hours to minutes. Moreover, it opens a possibility for customers to assess the data quality on their own without a need for a domain data operator. The combination of this automatic data quality control with existing vitalization and data-handling tools (all coded in Python) make this product unique on the market."

Jedno z možných riešení na prehľadávanie priestoru určitých problémov sú kvantové počítače pracujúce na báze qubitov. Ich efektivita oproti počítačom s klasickými bitmi je neporovnateľná. Napriek tomu sú kvantové počítače stále vo svojich začiatkoch a len málokto má tú možnosť fyzicky s nimi pracovať. Dnes však môžeme pracovať s kvantovými počítačmi z pohodlia nášho domova - pomocou python knižnice Qiskit vytvoriť kvantové obvody a poslať ich do jedného z niekoľkých reálnych kvantových počítačov. Výsledky z kvantového počítača pracujúceho až s 15 qubitmi tak môže získať ktokoľvek. A to je len začiatok novej, stále neprebádanej éry."

Together with my colleagues, we started with simple tasks that were periodically gathering data and computing aggregate values of timeseries within a research project. This was actually copybook example of Celery usage, with little bit of Celery beat and tasks chaining. Saturated with success, I decided to use Celery for Layman, a web service that publishes even large geospatial datasets through REST API. Redis as a broker, Flask as web application framework. There came need to effectively and safely abort running task. Or actually chain of tasks. And sometimes from different process than the one that started the chain. That's where thing got unexpectedly complicated and story of AbortableAsyncResult, persisting results and tracking task states starts."

You can use these for example for read alignment, sequence alignment, variant calling, and other domain specific tasks. Often, these collections contain hundreds of tools, and overlaps in function may occur.\n\nFor more general, but typical tasks of these areas of science - eg. data cleaning, statistics, clustering, classification or image analysis -, one would need other packages available in the Python ecosystem.

Ak sa rozhodnete prísť na tento workshop a budete chcieť robiť na vlastnom laptope, prosím postupujte podľa pokynov v tomto dokumente: http://bit.ly/2P54h5O (stačí len časť o inštalácii editora Mu a v prípade windowsákov aj inštalácia ovládačov)."
